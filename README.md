## Dungeon Master

This is a miniproject for a module in my degree. This is (currently!) a text based adventure game. The objective is to slay all the monsters and escape the dungeon.

## Rules and design

I am attempting to create this game with the object oriented programming style, following good naming conventions and good design principles for OOP. 

The game begins with the player selecting a class, Mage, Warrior or Hunter. Each has varying health attributes and damage, plus a special move that allows the user to gain bonuses based on their class. Players can move around the dungeon, and fight "Bosses", which are monsters with variying health and attack attributes. 

Players can pick up items and earn gold for monsters slain, which will allow them to buy items in the game.
